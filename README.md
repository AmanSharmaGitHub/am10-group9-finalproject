# Group 9-Final Project

<h3> Our Topic: </h3>
We decided to focus on League of Legends for our project, a Multi Player Battle Arena game. Two teams, Red and Blue, composed of 5 players each, battle each other and try to destroy the enemy to win the game. 

<h3> The Dataset </h3>
Our League of Legends dataset contains stats about the first 10mins of approximately 10k games played by top-rank players. Included in this dataset we have a unique identifier for each game, a column that shows whether the Blue team or the Red team won the game, and 19 variables per team showing the stats and features of the game collected in the first 10mins.

<h3> Issues and questions addressed: </h3>
Since each League of Legends game lasts around 25-40 minutes, the first 10 minutes of the game are crucial for both teams to reach a point in which they confidently say they could win or lose. Players can also choose to surrender after 10 minutes of playing. Given these factors, the main purpose of our project is to address these questions: "What is the best strategy to adopt to win the game, and when should a team decided to surrender at the 10 minute mark?"

<h3> Statistical techniques used: </h3>
To address this question, we used various statistical techniques. After making the data set usable, we explored the data using correlation matrices and scatter plots. To dive deeper and understand the underlying relationships between the variables and whether the blue team won we used linear and logistic regression.
